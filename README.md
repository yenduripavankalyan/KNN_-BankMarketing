How to use Google Colab?

If you want to create a machine learning model but say you donâ€™t have a computer that can take the workload, Google Colab is the platform for you. Even if you have a GPU or a good computer creating a local environment with anaconda and installing packages and resolving installation issues are a hassle.
Colaboratory is a free Jupyter notebook environment provided by Google where you can use free GPUs and TPUs which can solve all these issues.

Getting Started
To start working with Colab you first need to log in to your google account, then go to this link https://colab.research.google.com.

Opening Jupyter Notebook:
On opening the website you will see a pop-up containing tabs like:
Example,
recent tabs,
google drive etc

Else you can create a new Jupyter notebook by clicking New Python3 Notebook or New Python2 Notebook at the bottom right corner.

On creating a new notebook, it will create a Jupyter notebook with Untitled0.ipynb and save it to your google drive in a folder named Colab Notebooks. 
Now as it is essentially a Jupyter notebook, all commands of Jupyter notebooks will work here. 
Though, you can refer the details in Getting started with Jupyter Notebook.
